## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for building Java-based web applications.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for storing application data.
- **RabbitMQ:** Message broker for handling asynchronous communication between components.
- **OAuth2:** Authentication and authorization framework for securing APIs.
- **S3:** Object storage service for managing and storing multimedia content.
- **Google Cloud:** Cloud services integration for additional functionality.

## Getting Started
To run the Locket Application APIs locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the database connection in the `application.yml` file located in the src/main/resources directory.
3. Set up OAuth2 and obtain client credentials.
4. Configure refresh token settings.
5. Set up S3 credentials for storage.
6. Integrate Google Cloud services as needed.
7. Build and run the Spring Boot application.

## Authentication
The APIs use OAuth2 for authentication. Obtain an access token using the OAuth2 flow to authenticate requests to protected endpoints.

## API Endpoints
Detailed information about the available endpoints and their usage is provided in the [API Documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Message Queue
RabbitMQ is utilized for asynchronous communication between different components of the application. Understand the message queue flow for effective communication.

## Storage
S3 is used for storing multimedia content. Learn how to interact with the storage service for uploading, retrieving, and managing media files.

## Google Cloud Integration
Explore the integration with Google Cloud services for additional functionality and features.

## Contributing
